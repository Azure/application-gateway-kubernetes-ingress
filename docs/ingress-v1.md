# Ingress V1 Support

This document describes AGIC's implementation of specific Ingress resource fields and features.
As the Ingress specification has evolved between v1beta1 and v1, any differences between versions are highlighted to ensure clarity for AGIC users.

**Note: Ingress/V1 is fully supported with AGIC >= 1.5.1**

## Kubernetes Versions
For Kubernetes version 1.19+, the API server translates any Ingress v1beta1 resources to Ingress v1 and AGIC watches Ingress v1 resources.

## IngressClass and IngressClass Name

AGIC now supports using `ingressClassName` property along with `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway` to indicate that a specific ingress should processed by AGIC.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shopping-app
spec:
  ingressClassName: azure-application-gateway
  ...
```

## Ingress Rules

### Wildcard Hostnames
AGIC supports [wildcard hostnames](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#hostname-wildcards) as documented by the upstream API as well as precise hostnames.

* Wildcard hostnames are limited to the whole first DNS label of the hostname, e.g. `*.foo.com` is valid but `*foo.com`, `foo*.com`, `foo.*.com` are not.
`*` is also not a valid hostname.

### PathType property is now mandatory

AGIC now supports [PathType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#path-types) in Ingress V1.

* `Exact` path matches will now result in matching requests to the given path exactly.
* `Prefix` patch match type will now result in matching requests with a "segment prefix" rather than a "string prefix" according to the spec (e.g. the prefix `/foo/bar` will match requests with paths `/foo/bar`, `/foo/bar/`, and `/foo/bar/baz`, but not `/foo/barbaz`).
* `ImplementationSpecific` patch match type preserves the old path behaviour of AGIC < 1.5.1 and allows to backwards compatibility.

Example Ingress YAML with different pathTypes defined: 
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shopping-app
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo             # this would stay /foo since pathType is Exact
        pathType: Exact
      - path: /bar             # this would be converted to /bar* since pathType is Prefix
        pathType: Prefix
      - path: /baz             # this would stay /baz since pathType is ImplementationSpecific
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
      - path: /buzz*           # this would stay /buzz* since pathType is ImplementationSpecific
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```

### Behavioural Change Notice
* Starting with AGIC 1.5.1,
    * AGIC will now **strip** `*` from the path if `PathType: Exact`
    * AGIC will now **append** `*` to path if `PathType: Prefix`
* Before AGIC 1.5.1,
    * `PathType` property was ignored and path matching was performed using Application Gateway [wildcard path patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/url-route-overview#pathpattern).
    * Paths prefixed with `*` were treated as `Prefix` match and without were treated as `Exact` match.
* To continue using the old behaviour, use `PathType: ImplementationSpecific` match type in AGIC 1.5.1+ to ensure backwards compatibility.

Here is a table illustrating the **corner cases** where the behaviour has changed:

| AGIC Version | < 1.5.1 | < 1.5.1 | >= 1.5.1 | >= 1.5.1 |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| PathType | Exact | Prefix | Exact | Prefix |
| Path | /foo* | /foo | /foo* | /foo |
| Applied Path | /foo* | /foo | /foo (* is stripped) | /foo* (* is appended) |

Example YAML illustrating the corner cases above:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shopping-app
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /foo*            # this would be converted to /foo since pathType is Exact
        pathType: Exact
      - path: /bar             # this would be converted to /bar* since pathType is Prefix
        pathType: Prefix
      - path: /baz*             # this would stay /baz* since pathType is Prefix
        pathType: Prefix
```

#### Mitigation
In case you are affected by this behaviour change in mapping the paths, You can modify your ingress rules to use `PathType: ImplementationSpecific` so to retain the old behaviour.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shopping-app
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /path*         # this would stay /path* since pathType is ImplementationSpecific
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
```
