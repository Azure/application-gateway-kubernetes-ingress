## Troubleshooting: AGIC fails with aad identity breaking changes

### Illustration
AAD Pod Identity introduced a [breaking change](https://github.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/tree/v1.6.0#v160-breaking-change) after v1.5.5 regarding CRD fields become case sensitive.
When using user assigned identity with AGIC version < v1.2.0-rc2, in case to apply AAD Pod Identity version >= 1.6.0 or from AAD master branch such as https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/master/deploy/infra/deployment-rbac.yaml, an error as shown below will be raised due to the breaking change, the error is caused by AAD Pod Identiy fields are mismatched to what AGIC uses.

#### AGIC fix to adapt to the break change
Updated AGIC helm templates to use the right fields regarding AAD Pod Identity, [PR](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/pull/825/files) for reference.


### Resolve the issue
It's recommended to upgrade your AGIC to release 1.2.0 and then apply AAD Pod Identity version >= 1.6.0
#### Upgrade AGIC to 1.2.0
AGIC version at least [v1.2.0-rc2](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.2.md#v120-rc2) or release [v1.2.0](https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/releases/tag/1.2.0) will be required.

```
# https://github.com/Azure/application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/blob/master/docs/how-tos/helm-upgrade.md
# --reuse-values   when upgrading, reuse the last release's values and merge in any overrides from the command line via --set and -f. If '--reset-values' is specified, this is ignored

helm repo update

# check the latest relese version of AGIC
helm search repo -l application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress

# install release 1.2.0
helm upgrade \
  <release-name> \
  application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/ingress-azure

# install rc version such as 1.2.0-rc2 
helm upgrade \
  <release-name> \
  application-gateway-kubernetes-ingress/ingress-azure \
  --reuse-values \
  --version 1.2.0-rc2
```

#### Install the right version of AAD Pod Idenity
if old version of AGIC being used, instead of upgrading AGIC as above, reinstall AAD Pod Identity with the right and recommended version, i.e. >= v1.6.0

- *RBAC enabled* AKS cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/v1.6.0/deploy/infra/deployment-rbac.yaml
```

- *RBAC disabled* AKS cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/v1.6.0/deploy/infra/deployment.yaml
```
