# Troubleshooting

[Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) is the most convenient way to troubleshoot any problems with your AKS
and AGIC installation. Launch your shell from [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com/) or by clicking the link:

### Inspect Kubernetes Installation

#### Pods, Services, Ingress
Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) continuously monitors the folowing Kubernetes resources: [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#creating-a-deployment) or [Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#what-is-a-pod), [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)


The following must be in place for AGIC to function as expected:
  1. AKS must have one or more healthy **pods**.
     Verify this from [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) with `kubectl get pods -o wide --show-labels`
     If you have a Pod with an `apsnetapp`, your output may look like this:
     ```bash
     delyan@Azure:~$ kubectl get pods -o wide --show-labels

     NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE                       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES   LABELS
     aspnetapp              1/1     Running   0          17h   10.0.0.6    aks-agentpool-35064155-1   <none>           <none>            app=aspnetapp
     ```

  2. One or more **services**, referencing the pods above via matching `selector` labels.
     Verify this from [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) with `kubectl get services -o wide`
     ```bash
     delyan@Azure:~$ kubectl get services -o wide --show-labels

     NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE   SELECTOR        LABELS
     aspnetapp           ClusterIP   10.2.63.254    <none>        80/TCP    17h   app=aspnetapp   <none>     
     ```

  3. **Ingress**, annotated with `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway`, referencing the service above
     Verify this from [Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) with `kubectl get ingress -o wide --show-labels`
     ```bash
     delyan@Azure:~$ kubectl get ingress -o wide --show-labels

     NAME        HOSTS   ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE   LABELS
     aspnetapp   *                 80      17h   <none>
     ```

  4. View annotations of the ingress above: `kubectl get ingress aspnetapp -o yaml` (substitute `aspnetapp` with the name of your ingress)
     ```bash
     delyan@Azure:~$ kubectl get ingress aspnetapp -o yaml

     apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       annotations:
         kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway
       name: aspnetapp
     spec:
       backend:
         serviceName: aspnetapp
         servicePort: 80
     ```

     The ingress resource must be annotated with `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway`.
 

#### Verify Observed Nampespace

* Get the existing namespaces in Kubernetes cluster. What namespace is your app
running in? Is AGIC watching that namespace? Refer to the
[Multiple Namespace Support](features/multiple-namespaces.md#enable-multiple-namespace-support)
documentation on how to properly configure observed namespaces.
```bash
# What namespaces exist on your cluster
kubectl get namespaces

# What pods are currently running
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
```


* The AGIC pod should be in the `default` namespace (see column `NAMESPACE`). A healthy pod would have `Running` in the `STATUS` column. There should be at least one AGIC pod.
```bash
# Get a list of the Application Gateway Ingress Controller pods
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --selector app=ingress-azure
```


* If the AGIC pod is not healthy (`STATUS` column from the command above is not `Running`):
  - get logs to understand why: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
  - for the previous instance of the pod: `kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous`
  - describe the pod to get more context: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`


* Do you have a Kubernetes
[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and
[Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resources?
```bash
# Get all services across all namespaces
kubectl get service --all-namespaces -o wide

# Get all ingress resources across all namespaces
kubectl get ingress --all-namespaces -o wide
```


* Is your [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) annotated with: `kubernetes.io/ingress.class: azure/application-gateway`? AGIC will only watch for Kubernetes Ingress resources that have this annotation.
```bash
# Get the YAML definition of a particular ingress resource
kubectl get ingress --namespace  <which-namespace?>  <which-ingress?>  -o yaml
```


* AGIC emits Kubernetes events for certain critical errors. You can view these:
  - in your terminal via `kubectl get events --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp`
  - in your browser using the [Kubernetes Web UI (Dashboard)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/)


# Logging Levels

AGIC has 3 logging levels. Level 1 is the default one and it shows minimal number of log lines.
Level 5, on the other hand, would display all logs, including sanitized contents of config applied
to ARM.

The Kubernetes community has established 9 levels of logging for
the [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/#kubectl-output-verbosity-and-debugging) tool. In this
repository we are utilizing 3 of these, with similar semantics:


| Verbosity | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|  1        | Default log level; shows startup details, warnings and errors |
|  3        | Extended information about events and changes; lists of created objects |
|  5        | Logs marshaled objects; shows sanitized JSON config applied to ARM |


The verbosity levels are adjustable via the `verbosityLevel` variable in the
[helm-config.yaml](examples/sample-helm-config.yaml) file. Increase verbosity level to `5` to get
the JSON config dispatched to
[ARM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview):
  - add `verbosityLevel: 5` on a line by itself in [helm-config.yaml](examples/sample-helm-config.yaml) and re-install
  - get logs with `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
