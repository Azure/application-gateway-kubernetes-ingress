The Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC) is a Kubernetes application, which makes it possible for [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/) customers to leverage Azure's native [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/application-gateway/) L7 load-balancer to expose cloud software to the Internet. AGIC monitors the Kubernetes cluster it is hosted on and continuously updates an App Gateway, so that selected services are exposed to the Internet.

The Ingress Controller runs in its own pod on the customer’s AKS. AGIC monitors a subset of Kubernetes Resources for changes. The state of the AKS cluster is translated to App Gateway specific configuration and applied to the [Azure Resource Manager (ARM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview).

AGIC is configured via the Kubernetes [Ingress resource](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/), along with Service and Deployments/Pods. It provides a number of features, leveraging Azure’s native App Gateway L7 load balancer. To name a few:
  - URL routing
  - Cookie-based affinity
  - SSL termination
  - End-to-end SSL
  - Support for public, private, and hybrid web sites
  - Integrated web application firewall

## General

### Setup

- [**Greenfield Deployment**](docs/setup/install-new.md): Instructions on installing AGIC, AKS and App Gateway on
blank-slate infrastructure.
- [**Brownfield Deployment**](docs/setup/install-existing.md): Install AGIC on an existing AKS and Application Gateway.

### Usage

[**Tutorials**](docs/tutorial.md): Refer to these to understand how you can expose an AKS service over HTTP or HTTPS, to the internet, using an Azure Application Gateway.

[**Features**](docs/features/): List of all available AGIC features.

[**Annotations**](docs/annotations.md): The Kubernetes Ingress specification does not allow all features of Application Gateway to be exposed through the ingress resource. Therefore we have introduced application gateway ingress controller specific annotations to expose application gateway features through an ingress resource. Please refer to these to understand the various annotations supported by the ingress controller, and the corresponding features that can be turned on in the application gateway for a given annotation.

[**How-To**](docs/how-tos/): This document maintains a collection of complex scenarios.

[**Upgrade/Rollback AGIC using helm**](docs/how-tos/helm-upgrade.md): This documents explains how to upgrade/rollback AGIC helm installation.
